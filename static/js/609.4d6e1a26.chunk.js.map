Capture Commander's Intent.** Intent is communicated via published operational concepts accompanied by a commander's Statement of Presumed Risk (w/SCA Residual Risk). This information is provided by the commander using an event or operation CONOPS or equivalent. Follow Security Control Assessor development guidance (RMF). Utilize artifacts from Appendix C, Item #11, SCA Explanation (Residual Risk and Categorization).\r\n\r\n**2. Artifact Package.** Refer to Appendix B for the complete Information Domain Artifact Package, including purpose and evidence requirements for each step. The staff being assessed assembles an Artifact Package (i.e. required data and information) including any ZT-specific variations. Gather artifacts for each step using the DoDI 8510 Risk Management Framework (RMF) as a general guide. Artifacts may also be identified and collected during pre-audit surveys. Step 2.8.x is done by the Zero Trust Portfolio Management Office (ZT PfMO). Artifact collection includes areas:\r\n\r\n> **2.1 Information Domain Technical Advisory Board (IDTAB)** specific artifacts in Appendix C, Items #9 and #10, including Cryptography, ICAM, DRM, SP, and Content Labeling. Include specific artifacts in Appendix C; incorporate a documented approach to configuration management, patch & vulnerability management, cybersecurity management (users/groups/passwords), scanning schedule and remediation plan, remote administration configuration. Provide any additional references for mission specific/unique areas.\r\n\r\n> **2.2 High-level overviews** showing existing architectures, as well as any proposed modifications or variances, using the appropriate DoD architecture framework formats (i.e., DoDAF Views) listed in Appendix C, Items #2 #5, and #8.\r\n\r\n> **2.3 DoDAF Views**, Unified Architecture Framework (UAF) depictions, and Core Services Maps for Data Flows and Use Cases in the assessment environment, as per Appendix C, Item #8.\r\n\r\n> **2.4 Copies of U.S. and Partner information sharing agreements (ISAs)** including signature pages per Appendix C, Item #3. Be prepared to explain how ISAs support actions involving connections among U.S. and non-U.S. environments.\r\n\r\n> **2.5 Show how architectures involving ZT support the mission**, including justification for linkages with partners. Provide any published concept(s) of employment (CONEMPs) and communications annexes for the affected environment. See Appendix C, Items #2, #3, and #4.\r\n\r\n> **2.6 Provide Cyber Security Service Provider/Active Cyber Defense Plans**, including continuous monitoring, auditing, incident response plans, supportability strategies, and Cyber Security Service Provider (CSSP) Implementation Plans, as per Appendix C, Items #12, #14, and #15.\r\n\r\n> **2.7. Show Threshold Guidance compliance.** Provide test evidence of security controls as found in the Classified Overlay, Intelligence Overlay, Threshold Guidance Appendix (i.e., Security Controls), and DoD Zero Trust Overlay [Draft]. Provide any additional control documents (e.g., National Security Memorandums and Binding Operational Directives) as per Appendix D, Items #6, #7, #8, #13, and #15.\r\n\r\n> **2.8. Support the Zero Trust Assessment.** Support ZT Activities Validation conducted by an approved DoD on-net team. This includes compliance assessments based on ZT activities (Step 2.8.1), Automated Security Validation - Version I (Step 2.8.2), and ZT acceptance criteria assessment (Step 2.8.3). Items #1, #8, #14, and #15 of Appendix C apply. Importantly, this independent ZT Assessment maps to the 72 Controls listed in Appendices D and E.\r\n\r\n**3. Independent On-Net Assessment.** After artifact collection, an authorized DoD team under ZT PfMO will conduct an \"independent, on-net\" assessment, typically in conjunction with Step 2.8. Staff support for this effort includes \"providing the keys\" to the tested environment to afford unimpeded access for analysis.\r\n\r\n**4. Risk Recommendation Report.** An assessment report will be generated by the IDTAB listing findings for the assessed environment as a whole.\r\n\r\n**5. Risk Governance Board Review.** The Risk Recommendation Report, including comments from the assessed command, is routed for formal review. Items not settled by the DoD Security Accreditation Working Group (DSAWG) will be forwarded to the DoD Information Security Risk Management Committee (ISRMC) for final adjudication. A letter will be issued with \"thou shalt\" criteria for follow-on actions.\r\n\r\n**6. Implementation.** The commander will publish a Commander's Statement on Implementation as a response to the DSAWG/ISRMC letter. Submit updates/artifacts as required. Follow ISRMC guidance and monitor the ZT environment accordingly.\r\n`\r\n\r\n\r\nconst IDAFFramework = () => {\r\n    return(\r\n        <ReactMarkdown children={markdown}/>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default IDAFFramework;"],"names":["IDAFFramework","_jsx","ReactMarkdown","children"],"sourceRoot":""}
